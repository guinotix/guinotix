            <p class="mt-4 mb-2 text-gray-500 text-xl leading-relaxed dark:text-gray-400">
                As a web application, Sailaway has been coded using <strong>Laravel</strong> as the main framework.
                It provides a lot of solutions that were addressed by the stakeholders, so the development was a really great experience.
                A <strong>MySQL database</strong> is used to store the data of the application.
                The testing environment is powered by <strong>PHPUnit</strong> to ensure that database accesses and modifications are done properly for the use cases defined.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-500 text-xl leading-relaxed dark:text-gray-400">
                Some things that Laravel provided were <strong>Authentication</strong> and <strong>Authorization</strong>, the usage of <strong>Eloquent ORM</strong> to interact easier with the database, <strong>Database migrations</strong> to define a proper database schema, <strong>Validation</strong> of the HTTP requests and finally the management of <strong>Notifications</strong> via email.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-500 text-xl leading-relaxed dark:text-gray-400">
                About the frontend tools, <strong>Blade templates</strong> paired with <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> are used to define all the pages with a simple design used a color pallete provided by the stakeholder.
