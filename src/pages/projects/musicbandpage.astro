                Music Band Page (MBP) is a combination of a Blog + E-commerce site for music artists or bands.
                It provides a simple interface, mainly based on online stores that I have taken as a reference.
                It also has an administration panel to manage the content of the blog as well as the products that are available in the store.

            <p class="mt-4 mb-2 leading-relaxed">
                MBP has been coded with the <strong>RILT</strong> stack (React, Inertia.js, Laravel and Tailwind CSS).
                The Admin panel has been developed using <strong>Filament</strong>, for managing products, orders, and the blog posts.
                <strong>SQLite</strong> is used to store the data of the application.
                <strong>Stripe</strong> handles all the customer payments and the updates are done concurrently with the database to ensure data integrity.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                About the graphic design, the color scheme used is the Laravel default (black and red). In the same way, the logo has not been changed for simplicity.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Overall, the development was based around learning how an E-commerce application works behind the scenes.
